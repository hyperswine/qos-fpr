/* proc_entry.c -- the process entry point (docs/PROCESS-LOADING.md).

 * the ELF header's e_entry at it -- no assembly needed, since we are
 * not booting hardware here, we're being called by an already-running
 * loader on an already-running hart).
 *
 * What it does NOT do, on purpose, contrasted with crt0.S:
 *   - no secondary-hart wfi-park dance: on the SHARED PLANE (the
 *     normal path now) the process has no harts of its own at all --
 *     its actors are transparent pid-tagged ACBs in the kernel's
 *     per-hart queues, donated and stolen across every live hart like
 *     System.qa's own; the legacy branch below is single-hart
 *   - no fpr_rvv_enable() call (mstatus.VS is hart-global; if the
 *     loader's hart already enabled it, it's already on for us)
 *   - no reading of fixed _heap_start/_heap_end linker symbols for the
 *     heap -- the CALLER hands us our arena, because it came from
 *     System.qa's buddy allocator, not from our own link
