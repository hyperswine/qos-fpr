/* qos_abi.h -- the QOS Portable host <-> app ABI (docs/QOS-PORTABLE.md).
 *
 * Shared by runtime/portable (the qosp host, hosted C with libc) and
 * runtime/qosapp (the app-side runtime, freestanding).  This is the
 * bootstrap design's HAL contract realized on a host OS: "the HAL is a
 * table delivered as a C pointer, called like regular C functions" --
 * the app image contains NO libc and NO syscalls; every effect it can
 * have on the world goes through this table, and the table's entries
 * are the image's runtime capability surface (the link-time fpr_g_
 * import set remains the static one, exactly as on bare metal).
 *
 * Only fixed-width C ABI types cross the boundary: the host and the
 * app are separately linked images that happen to share an address
 * space, the same relationship System.qa has with a loaded process on
 * virt.  No V values cross it in v1 -- both sides build their own.
