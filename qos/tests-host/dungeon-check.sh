# dungeon-check.sh -- the dungeon crawler, played to a win under Xvfb.
#
# Builds the game .qa and qosp-gl, replays a fixed key file (FPR_EVDEV)
# and asserts the transcript the shell prints -- which is the game's own
# account of the mechanics translated out of the Java original: treasure
# taken, a sword picked up and an enemy killed with it, both boulders
# heaved onto their floor switches, a key found and its door unlocked, a
# nuke used, a portal traversed, and the AND/OR goal tree satisfied by
# the "no enemies left, then the exit" arm.  Then the frames: 960x600
# PPMs the P key read back, none of them blank.  A second, shorter leg
# replays the screens (help, restart, the death message).  Needs
# xvfb-run and libglfw; check-all.sh skips the leg without them.
#
# The whole game is deterministic -- no clock, no randomness, one key per
# tick -- so this key file plays the same game on every machine.

# The winning line, key by key.  Start; look at the help screen and come
# back; snapshot the board.  Then: east onto the treasure, back and south
# for the sword, south down the column-4 corridor -- where the first
# enemy meets us and takes two swings to fall -- west to the boulder
# room.  Heave the north boulder onto its switch and the east one onto
# the other.  South-west for key 2, back east to its door, through.  Take
# the nuke in the far room and set it off on the enemy that followed us.
# Wait out the last one against a wall, cut it down, then step into the
# portal, which drops us in the bottom corridor a step from the exit.
