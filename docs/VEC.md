# Vec — the compute-bound default

`Vec a` is meant to be the type you reach for without thinking when
code is compute-bound: a growable array that stores records as
columns, fuses adjacent passes, and turns ordinary functional element
functions into dense column loops.  You should never write
`Vec.axpb` or `Vec.iadd` by hand.  `Vec.map (fn v -> a * v.x + c) vs`
is the API.

This file records the DECISIONS, not the code.  Where a decision was
contested, the losing option is named too, so a later reader knows it
was weighed rather than missed.

## 1. Representation: ONE contiguous span per column (v2)

A column is one contiguous run of machine words, grown by
realloc-by-doubling (`fpr_realloc`).  Push is amortized O(1); the
copy a growth pays is attributed to the push that grew it, keeping
WCET compositional; indexing is base + i.  Every consumer — the
specialized/RVV loops, the gfx scene walker, GPU upload — strides one
span with no directory hop and no per-block re-entry.

The LOSING option, recorded (it shipped first): a VList block
directory, chosen when the allocator had no realloc — "no
realloc-and-leak under a bump+freelist allocator" was true, and the
fix was to add the missing op, not to structure every vector around
its absence.  What the VList cost: log2 index math on every random
access, per-block strip-mining in every specialized emitter, and the
layout restated in four places (vec.c, two gfx.c mirrors, the GPU
paths).  The realloc churn worry resolves the other way now: the
freed predecessor recycles EXACTLY (buckets below the ceiling, the
bigfree LIFO above it), so a doubling ladder reuses its own history;
the transient old+new footprint during a growth is the one real cost
(visible as tests/bigfree.fpr's steady arena reading 5MB where the
VList read 3MB — still flat across cycles, which is the property that
matters).  In-place growth (no copy at all) arrives where storage
sits on a buddy: `buddy_realloc` already extends a low-half block by
absorbing its free buddy.

## 2. Conversion from List is cheap and explicit

`List a` stays the cons-cell list — one slab per constructor, the
Haskell-shaped structure you want for symbolic and recursive code.
`Vec.fromList` / `Vec.toList` convert.  Nothing converts implicitly:
the cost is a traversal and the user should see it.

## 3. SoA by default for records

When the first value pushed into a Vec is a record, the vector takes
one COLUMN PER FIELD.  Records carry their field count in the value
header (`var`), so a record value is self-describing and the runtime
can pick the layout without a type-directed hint — this is what makes
"SoA by default" real rather than aspirational.

Bounds, stated: up to 8 fields (`VMAXCOLS`); wider records fall back
to boxed rows.  The layout is fixed by the FIRST push and every later
push must match it.  Storage and specialization have separate bounds:
the AOT record-map dualizer currently specializes outputs of up to 4
fields, so 5..8-field records are still SoA but their maps use the
generic row-by-row tier unless another specialization accepts the site.

### Record projections and updates are the lens surface

The record syntax is the element-function API; vectors do not introduce
separate column getters or setters:

  p.x                          # getter
  {p | x = p.x + 1}           # functional setter
  {p | pose.x = p.pose.x + 1} # composed nested setter

Projections infer through open rows, so a function that reads `.x` can
accept any record shape containing `x`.  An update evaluates its source
once and rebuilds the records along the named path from the leaf outward;
untouched fields are projected from the source.  This is lens-like
lowering, but there is no first-class `Lens` value and no mutable
`p.x = value` expression syntax.  `=` introduces bindings; the supported
setter spelling is `{p | path = value}`.

After lowering, a flat update has the same `CProj`/`CMk` shape as an
explicit record reconstruction.  Therefore a same-shape arithmetic
update inside `Vec.map` can dualize directly against columns and can
participate in adjacent-map fusion.  `tests/fuse.fpr` executes this path.
Nested record construction inside an output field currently makes the
AOT dualizer decline, so a nested-path update remains semantically correct
but runs through the reported generic tier.

## 4. Element functions get DUALIZED — no special vocabulary

The core promise.  A function passed to a `Vec.x` operation is
compiled against the column representation instead of against boxed
rows:

    Vec.map (fn s -> s.age + 1) students
      -- becomes, per column: out[i] = age[i] + 1

The compiler walks the element function to its record construction and
produces one unboxed dual per OUTPUT field, whose arguments are the
input columns it actually reads (plus captured scalars).  The loop
then runs in place over the columns with no boxing, no allocation, and
no `fpr_apply` per row.  `Mat4 * Vec4` is the same mechanism: the
operator elaborates to field arithmetic, which dualizes to axpb-shaped
column loops.  The user never names axpb.

When dualization does NOT apply the site still WORKS — it runs the
generic apply tier row by row — and the compiler SAYS SO:

    vec note: Vec.map over `f` runs in the GENERIC apply tier ...

Silence used to be the bug: a whole class of "specialized" loops was
emitted and never executed for ten rounds because nothing reported the
fallback.  A declined site is a performance fact the compiler owes the
programmer at compile time.

Record FOLDS with a scalar accumulator now DUALIZE, named fns and
capture-free lambdas alike (tests/recfold.fpr executes the column
loop): a row-polymorphic body whose projections bound a UNIQUE shape
carries no CTagEq dispatch, and the fold dualizer now accepts the
zero-test body -- the dual is exactly as shape-checked as the generic
tier it replaces, so the spec guard degrades to ncols/kinds only.

Known genuine declines today: element functions that pattern-match or
otherwise reconstruct opaquely, nested record updates/construction
inside an output field, RECORD-accumulator folds (fold duals are
scalar-acc; the note names them), AOT record-map outputs over 4
fields, and boxed records over 8 fields.

Target caveat: on x64 (qosp on x86-64) the ENTIRE specialization tier
is off -- SysV has only 6 callee-saved registers and the spec loops
need s6+ -- so every Vec site runs the generic apply tier there.  The
decline scan is NO LONGER gated on the tier flag: an x64 compile now
reports every named-fn site, and a site a column loop would accept
says so explicitly ("the specialization tier is OFF on this target
... rv64/a64 builds specialize it").  a64 and rv64 keep the tier.
Fusion however runs on EVERY target (fewer generic passes is still a
win, and linearity -- not the spec loops -- is what makes the rewrite
sound); tests/fuse.fpr's in-place witnesses still hold on
bare-metal/a64 only, because the x64 generic tier boxes per row.

## 5. Fusion by default for adjacent passes

`Vec.map f (Vec.map g v)` — and the let-pipeline spelling when the
intermediate's only use is the immediately following map — compiles
to ONE pass over a synthesized composite.  Fused record pipelines
compose at the plan level: g's output field k is f's input column k,
so f's column reads substitute with g's field-k dual bodies.

Soundness comes from linearity, not from an effect analysis: both
passes mutate the same columns and return the same reference, so a
fused single pass leaves byte-identical final state and the
intermediate was never observable by anyone.

Fusion runs to a FIXPOINT: a 3+ chain collapses completely (round 1
fuses the outer pair, round 2 the composite over the next map, and so
on -- tests/vecfuse2.fpr's `_vfuse_1_*` asm names are the round-2
witness).  Pair collection walks the same seeLet-transformed tree the
rewriter walks, so pipeline-only pairs register too.

`Vec.fold f z (Vec.map g v)` now fuses through the WRITE-BACK FOLD:
one specialized pass stores g(el) back into the column AND folds f
over the stored value, so the map's writes stay program-visible
through the returned vector exactly as the two-pass program left them
(re-folding the result is vecfuse2's witness).  Scalar int tier in
v1; the runtime fallback is the honest two-pass sequence (generic
map, then generic fold), so a rep mismatch loses only the fusion.

Bounds, stated: one captured side per fused map pair; the write-back
fold takes capture-free g and int columns only (anything else falls
back to the plain fold plan, whose map argument then specializes on
its own).

## 6. Filter: eager compaction shipped, the MASK is the direction

What ships: `Vec.filter` slides the kept rows down IN PLACE with two
cursors and shrinks `len`.  Zero allocation, and the vector stays
dense for every later pass.

The REVISED decision (docs/MEMORY.md v2): conditional operations
should not branch per element.  The end-state filter writes a MASK
column — the predicate evaluated branchlessly, cmov/SIMD-select
lanes — scans FUSE the mask as a lane select, and density is restored
by an explicit `Vec.compact` or automatically at `Sys.poolReset`:
compaction becomes a frame-boundary event, one branch-light pass,
instead of a data-dependent branch inside the hot loop.

The original counterargument, kept because it was real: masked lanes
predicate every downstream pass, and incremental reclamation
re-introduces unpredictable work into length-priced operations.  The
v2 answers: the mask is fused, not carried as control flow (a select
is not a branch, and the wide targets this tier is shaped for — RVV,
NEON — have first-class lane masks); and there is no incremental
anything — compaction stays a single explicit pass, WCET a function
of length, just scheduled at the loop boundary the program names.
A program that wants the old behavior writes `filter |> compact` —
the policy moves into the program, where this codebase puts policy.

Capacity past the new length stays attached and recycles with the
column.

## 7. Linearity is the contract that makes it all sound

`Vec a` is linear.  In-place mutation, fusion, and compaction are all
licensed by single ownership — no structural sharing, no Rc traffic
per element operation.  Operations consume the vector and hand it
back (often inside a tuple, e.g. `Vec.fold` returns `(acc, vec)`).

Using a Vec non-linearly is a compile error, not a silent copy.  This
is deliberate: a silent deep copy of a compute-bound array is the
single worst thing a "helpful" runtime could do here.

Enforcement is INFERENCE-DRIVEN (the audit's hole, closed): the
checker's shapes come from three sources, most-authored first --
explicit signatures, the INFERRED types of unannotated binds, and the
builtin prims' own types (derived from the type environment itself,
so the table cannot drift).  An unannotated `main` that double-frees
a let-bound Vec, or a sigless `g v = (Vec.len v, Vec.len v)`, is now
refused with the same exactly-once error a declared signature always
bought.  Corollary made uniform on the way: SString READS
(SStr.len/at/toStr) now THREAD their handle back as `(value, handle)`
-- the Vec.len convention -- because a "read" typed as consuming
without returning a successor is unusable under exactly-once, and a
borrow exemption for reads would have been unsound for Vec (a
`Vector -> Int` fn that folds AND frees would type identically to a
borrow).

## 8. Tier structure

    declared float columns ('i'/'d'/'s'/'b')   -- widths chosen, not guessed
    dualized column loops (map / fold / mvmap) -- the default fast path
    C prim tier (axpb, zip*, gather, blend...) -- what the duals lower onto
    generic apply tier                         -- correct, reported, slow

Each tier is a fallback for the one above, and every fall is either a
compile-time note or a declared choice.

## Open, in agreed order

1. record -> scalar projection maps (layout-changing: new 1-col output)
2. record-ACCUMULATOR fold duals (per-field acc registers)
3. write-back fold beyond scalar ints (float columns, captured g, SoA)
4. x64 spec tier (needs register re-budgeting or spills: SysV has no
   s6+ callee-saved; today the tier is off there and SAYS SO per site)

Done since the audit: write-back fold (fold-of-map fuses), fusion
fixpoint, scalar-acc record-fold duals (named fns and capture-free
lambdas), loud x64 declines, RVV shipped behind `RVV=1`.

## RVV status (audit, 2026-08)

The `--rvv` lowering (strip-mined `vsetvli` loops, `vle64/vadd.vv`
folds) is FUNCTIONALLY CORRECT: tests/fuse.fpr passes all seven
witnesses under `qemu -cpu rv64,v=true` when built with it.  But the
path is dormant and unshipped:

Both blockers are now closed and the path is SHIPPED behind a knob:

  * `make bare-metal-run PROG=... RVV=1` passes `--rvv` to fprc,
    assembles with `-march=rv64imafdcv_zicsr`, and boots QEMU with
    `-cpu rv64,v=true`; the check-all RVV leg runs vecfuse2 this way
  * the enable shim is emitted in a COMDAT group
    (`.section .text.fpr_rvv_enable,"axG",...,comdat`): every --rvv
    unit carries the identical definition, the linker keeps one, and
    the surviving strong symbol overrides runtime.c's weak no-op --
    multi-unit programs link cleanly, V-less builds never touch
    mstatus.VS
  * without RVV=1 nothing changes; the C prim tier still compiles
    scalar on rv64 (its autovectorization is real only on hosted
    x64/a64 baselines: adds/compares/blend take SSE2/NEON lanes,
    64-bit multiplies stay scalar below AVX-512)
