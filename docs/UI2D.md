# The 2D layer: scene2d over a 3D scene

A game wants a HUD, panels, a hand of cards facing the viewer -- and later
a mouse.  The scene walker draws one Scene per frame with one camera, so
the 2D UI is a SECOND PASS over the same frame (qosp v10):

    glRenderUi scene ui dist   -> (draws, dynBytes)

`scene` is drawn as `glRender` draws it; then, with the depth buffer
cleared and the colour kept, `ui` -- a List of Ent in mods/scene2d's
pixel space -- is drawn with the Int camera at `dist` milli on +Z looking
at the origin and a light behind the camera (faces carry their instance
colour).  One present at the end.  `mods/glsvc.fpr` takes the view's
value as `(scene, (ents, dist), snap)`; `(Nil, 0)` means no layer.

scene2d does the rest: a view AST (`Box attrs kids`, `Lbl attrs text`)
laid out like a miniature flexbox (`Row`/`Col`, `Pad`, `Gap`, `W`/`H`,
`Grow`, `Bg`/`Fg`/`Bord`, `Sc` for text scale) and emitted as thin cubes
-- one per box, border strip and lit glyph cell of its 5x8 font.
`S2.buildW (vw, vh) tree` gives the entities; `S2.camAt vh` the camera
distance.  Pick the virtual size as the window at an integer scale so
every glyph cell is a whole number of real pixels (Terra II now runs
the layer at 960 x 600, one virtual px per window px).

## The second face, and the box treatments

The cell font is honest but it is not modern.  The walker now carries a
second face: DejaVu Sans Bold baked into a signed-distance-field atlas
(`fp-risc/tools/mkfont.py` -> `hal/unix/font_sdf.h`, 95 glyphs in 32 x 32
texel cells, compiled into the host) and a text pass after the meshes.
A text entity is

    Ent (mode, "string") pen 0 (em, em, 1) colour

with the string in the mesh slot: mode 0 stands it upright in its local
XY plane, mode 1 lays it flat on the ground; `pen` is the left end of
the baseline, `em` the size in world milli.  The fragment shader
thresholds the sampled distance with an `fwidth`-wide ramp, which is
what keeps a 20 px source crisp at 12 px and at 64 px alike -- and one
entity per label instead of one cube per lit cell.  The metrics live
in `mods/fontm.fpr` (advances in milli-em, ascent, line) so layout can
size and centre text without seeing a glyph; both sides draw from the
same table.  Text must be in a dynamics or UI list (statics compile to
instance buffers, which text is not).

In scene2d a `Lbl` or `Slot` with `Fs em` (em in px) uses that face and
emits one entity.  With it come the box treatments a modern surface
wants, all flat geometry:

    Round r      corners of radius r: three rects and four quarter
                 discs (the "corner" mesh, mirrored by sign of scale),
                 so a translucent shape never draws a texel twice
    Shadow       a dark translucent copy three px below, one wider
    Bga (r,g,b,a)  a translucent fill (Bg stays the opaque one)
    Bord c       with a fill: a one-px ring (the border colour under
                 the fill inset by one); without: four strips
    Center       children centred along the axis (when nothing grows)
    Mid          children centred across it instead of stretched

The walker gained the flat meshes to go with them: `quad` (the fill
itself -- single-sided, so a translucent one blends exactly once, where
a thin cube's back face blended too and came out three times darker
than its alpha), `disc` (XY, faces +Z), `corner` (a quarter of it),
`arc` (a quarter ring: a rounded one-px border is four strips and four
of these, never under the fill) and `coin` (XZ, faces +Y, for rings and
pads on the ground).  Depth per node is now three steps (shadow, border,
fill; text and children above), still 5 milli each.  A second tree can
be laid over the first from a deeper start (`S2.buildAt vp tree d0`):
Terra II's pause menu is one, over a veil, over the game's own layer.

For that to come out right the walker's translucent pass is one sorted
stream: after every mesh's opaque instances, all translucent instances
of all meshes AND the text glyphs are sorted far to near together and
drawn in runs, so a veil (a quad) dims the chips (corners, arcs) and
the labels (text) beneath it whatever mesh they use.

Terra II rebuilds its tree from the model every frame: a glass status
bar with chips for the turn, the sides and the ENV, the message line,
a unit panel at the right (a header band coloured by kind, stat chips,
the keys that apply as key caps), the banner in a glass pill, the hand
along the bottom as rounded, shadowed cards with a kind band, a cost
badge and big figures, the cursor's card lifted, lit and rimmed amber.
Under a thousand instances plus a few hundred glyph quads a frame.

Every box has a rectangle in the 960 x 600 space, and that is what a
mouse will hit-test against: a click is a point in the same space, so
picking a card or a button is a rectangle test on the tree, no
raycasting.  Not wired yet -- the walker reports relative mouse motion
only -- but the layout is where it will hang.
