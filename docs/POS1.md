# POS v1 on QOS: the shop as one log

`fp-risc/programs/pos1.fpr` is docs/POS1-DESIGN.md built in FP-RISC on
QOS Portable: a point of sale for one small shop, served by FPRLive
(docs/FPRLIVE.md) to any number of registers, with the disk holding ONE
append-only log that is the shop.

    ./qos.py run programs/pos1.fpr        open http://127.0.0.1:8123/
    sign in as ana / 1234 (or ben / 2222)

The example in the design (S9) runs as written: sign in, add two items,
checkout with cash, the toast and the receipt, void it, stock returns,
restart the process, the receipt and the void are still there.

## The one rule

Every change to the shop is a LINE, and one function -- `apply` -- is
the only thing that reads a line into the model.  A live handler
validates (guards that refuse and say why), then `commit`s the line:
apply it and queue it for the disk.  Boot is the same `apply` folded
over the log.  So the state a register shows is, by construction, what
a restart would rebuild; there is no second interpretation of a sale.

    product <sku> <price> <stock> <name...>
    retire <sku> <cashier> <at>          staff <name> <pin>
    tax <basis points>   lowat <n>       price <sku> <cents> <cashier> <at>
    restock <sku> <delta> <cashier> <at>
    sale <n> <cashier> <at> <pay> <tendered> <total> <tax> <sku>=<qty>=<price>...
    void <n> <cashier> <at>

Against the design's invariants:

* **I1, a committed sale is immutable.** A void or a restock is a new
  line naming what it corrects; the receipt row keeps its number and
  wears the `void` badge.  Nothing rewrites a sale line, ever.
* **I2, checkout is atomic.** A checkout is ONE line: the receipt, the
  stock decrement and the revenue all come from it.  QLOG writes the
  commit flag ahead of every append and clears it after, so a page torn
  by a crash is rolled back at the next open -- the log is complete or
  the sale is absent, never half.
* **I3, one writer.** FPRLive's register actor runs `update`; every
  session's events serialize through it.  A session owns only its cart,
  its toast and its console output.
* **I4, bounded.** Cart 40 lines, quantity at most 999 and never above
  stock, restock 1..999 to a shelf of 9999, the Receipts page the
  newest 50, the console the last 12 lines, names 16 letters and
  digits.  Boot is one fold over the log.
* **I5, nothing memorised.** Every refusal is a toast that says what
  and why: "brownie: only 3 left, set to 3", "cash short by 2.40",
  "receipt #7 is already void", "no such action: bogus".
* **I6, colour is meaning.** A badge takes a role: `bad` (void, sold
  out), `warn` (low stock, a refused action), `ok` (paid, committed),
  `celebrate` (the first sale of the day).  Four toast slots, one per
  role, so a role change is a text delta rather than a reshape.
* **I7, unreliable environment.** The client reconnects with backoff
  and shows its link state; the register keeps working with no disk
  (the nav says so) for the run.  Offline queueing of events is not in
  this cut (see below).
* **I8, values, not shape.** The Admin tab is a data console over the
  live model: `get tax`, `set price FW 550`, `add SKU 450 10 name`,
  `retire SKU`, `staff NAME PIN`, `set lowat 2`, `rebuild`; every set
  is a log line like any other, and a watch list of the shop's numbers
  sits above it.  `rebuild` folds the disk again and compares every
  product's stock with the cache -- "stock matches the log" is the
  normal answer, and the log wins when they differ.

## What the walker of the design will notice

* Money is integer cents; the tax rate is basis points (1000 = 10%),
  rounded half up.  There are no floats.
* Time is the host's wall clock through a new builtin, `timeNow`
  (ABI v11; epoch seconds, 0 on a host without a clock), rendered as
  `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` UTC.
* Sign-in sends both fields at once: a `data-arg` may name several
  locals, joined by `|` (fprlivejs).
* The stylesheet is a function of the tree, and the page is served from
  the signed-out view -- so the rules the register needs would never be
  emitted.  `cssAll` builds the sheet over a SAMPLE tree that shows
  everything (a signed-in session with a cart, receipts with a void, the
  console), so every class the app can use appears once.  The page is a
  centred 1120 px container; the body's gradient is pinned and never
  repeats; a toast or console with no text is not shown (`:has`).
* The theme is a class on the page root, flipped by a message; it is
  the one reshape in steady state, on purpose.
* One log page per event.  The default 8 MB disk holds about two
  thousand events; the program declares `#: disk-mb 64` for the bundle
  and the harness runs on 64 MB.  Compaction does not shrink an
  append-only log (every line is live); a day-close record that folds
  the shop into a snapshot is the next step when the log outgrows the
  disk.

## Verified (qos/tests-host/pos1-check.py)

Websocket registers against the served app, on a fresh disk: the S9
example as pasted, including the restart; the guards (wrong PIN,
quantity clamped and said so, empty cart, short cash, unknown sku,
unknown action); the last-unit race (two registers ring the last one,
exactly one commits, the other is told, the badge reads sold out); void
twice; rebuild against the log; restock, a price set and read back, a
retire that leaves the register, a tax change that applies to the next
total; delta correctness (twelve quantity edits are twelve slot deltas
and no reshape; the theme flip is one); four crash windows (SIGKILL
across a checkout, then the receipt is complete or absent, numbering
contiguous, the cache equals the fold); three hundred receipts against
the capped page with flat round trips; quit stops the process.  A
check-all leg when `websockets` is installed.

## Not in this cut

Offline queueing with replay-on-reconnect (the client reconnects and
resumes, but events typed while offline are not queued), the receipt
printer and drawer, card processing (recorded, not processed), reports
beyond count and revenue, discounts, and the day-close snapshot.
