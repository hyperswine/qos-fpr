# The memory model (v2)

No GC. Ever. Three regimes — **linear by default, Rc as the fallback,
ARC only by explicit promotion** — over ONE dumb allocator contract:
`alloc / realloc / dealloc`, nothing else. The allocators assume
nothing and discover nothing; every lifetime decision is made by the
program (compiler-inserted linear frees, Rc dec sites, drop laws), and
the allocator just executes it.

Sections marked **[pending]** are contract the code has not caught up
with yet; docs/MEMORY-V2-PLAN.md maps each one to the mechanisms it
replaces, file:line. Everything else is live.

## The regimes

1. **Linear — the default.** Bulk data (SoA Vectors, BStr-class
   buffers, frames, models, scenes) has exactly one owner, is mutated
   in place through the threaded handle, and is freed at its one
   consume point (`Vec.free`, scope exit, autodrop). Growth is
   realloc-by-doubling; release is all-at-once. Provably-scoped work
   uses arenas (bump, free wholesale). Linear data carries NO
   refcount of any kind — not Rc, not CoW rc (the vec CoW is gone;
   the specialized column loops are sound by construction, not by
   documented exception).

2. **Rc — the fallback, intra-actor only.** Tree/list data that
   genuinely needs sharing inside one actor is reference-counted at
   the existing safepoints. Rc never crosses an actor boundary;
   there is nothing concurrent about it — inc/dec are plain stores.
   Rc-zero calls `dealloc`; that is the whole protocol.

3. **ARC — cross-actor, by explicit promotion only.** Nothing is
   ever promoted implicitly. `sendArc` gives OWNERSHIP of the object
   to **ARC.qa**, which spawns a small manager actor for it; the
   refcount is structurally atomic because it only changes by
   INC/DEC messages drained through that manager's single mailbox —
   actor topology IS the serialization, no lock anywhere in the
   mechanism. A promoted object is frozen (immutable) at promotion,
   so holders read through the pointer directly while their count is
   live; DEC-to-zero has the manager dealloc and die.
   **[pending: today's mechanism is still the HAL's locked ARC
   table + escaped-slab counts]**

## Sending — three verbs, no hidden modes

* **`send` deep-copies. No exceptions.** One message = one ownerless
  slab, vectors included (header, cols, and column spans all land in
  it — vec_layout.h is the contract); nothing is shared, nothing can
  dangle, and drop-of-root frees all of it. LIVE.
* **`sendLinear` moves.** Ownership transfers to the receiver; the
  sender's binding is consumed by the linearity checker (reuse after
  a move is refused by name). A received message root transfers as
  the SAME pointer — no copy, no count change; the one standing ARC
  count changes hands — so a relay chain (the frames loop,
  tests/frames.fpr + tests/sendlin.fpr) is zero-copy end to end.
  Anything else deep-copies and releases what the sender owned. LIVE.
* **`sendArc` shares — the ONE promotion path.** The pointer crosses,
  the object is frozen by contract, and the count is the number of
  HOLDERS: the sender's standing share is created at first promotion,
  each send adds the receiver's, every holder releases with `drop`
  (tests/sendarc.fpr: one tuple, three holders, balanced). A Vector
  is refused — linear bulk moves or copies, never shares. LIVE on
  the v1 mechanism; **[pending: the mechanism underneath moves from
  the HAL's table+lock to the mailbox-serialized ARC.qa]**

## The allocator contract

* **Buddy, owned by the memory actor (Memory.qa, stage 1 -- LIVE).**
  The image that runs `buddy_init` -- a machine boot, or the qosp app
  over the arena the host hands it whole (ABI v12: nothing past the
  loaded image belongs to the host any more) -- spawns ONE actor that
  owns the buddy, second in hart 0's queue after actor 0.  Every block
  the runtime needs from actor context is a message to it: pool
  slabs, message slabs, stacks, the acb and channel-block carves, a
  ring that doubles, the ARC table's next size.  A request is an
  Int (`bytes<<1|1` to take, `ptr>>1` to give -- buddy pointers are
  8-aligned, the low bit tells them apart), so the request path
  allocates nothing; the answer to a take is a store into the
  requester's acb plus a wake, never a mailbox message, so a full
  mailbox cannot lose it and the requester's open borrows are not
  drained by a receive.  Frees are one-way.  The actor is the
  SERIALISATION POINT, not the path every block takes: a requester
  that finds the buddy lock free serves itself on the spot
  (`buddy_alloc_try`; `Sys.memInfo` counts these as inline) and only
  one that finds it held queues on the actor -- a round trip through
  one actor on one hart costs more than the allocation and stalls
  whenever that hart is inside a long C section (the register copying
  a big model), which showed up as every other actor's allocations
  serialising behind it.  The actor is admitted ahead of the backlog
  (`prio`) so a queued request never waits on a reservoir draw.
  Contexts with no actor to park (boot, the hart loop's reaper, IRQ
  delivery) and the memory actor itself call the buddy directly.  No
  spinlock is ever held across a queued request: the sites that used
  to allocate under one (ring growth under the receiver's producer
  lock, the ARC rehash under `arc_lock`, the acb bump refill) take the
  block first, lock, and re-check.  The buddy implements all three
  ops: `buddy_alloc`, `buddy_realloc` (in place whenever the block is
  the low half and its buddy is free -- the natural substrate for
  realloc-by-doubling), `buddy_free`.
* **A dead actor's blocks go home.**  The reaper frees the stack and
  the escape-free slabs straight back to the memory actor; the
  process-mode recyclers that existed because a loader never took
  grants back (the grant pool, the stack freelist and its self-topping,
  the acb bump arena's leak) are gone from every image that owns a
  buddy.  What remains recycled: the bucket-array freelist (type-
  stable, tiny) and the channel-block epoch limbo (a stale send may
  still be reading a dead actor's rings -- docs/SCHEDULER.txt).  A
  loaded process WITHOUT a buddy (the legacy nested-scheduler launch
  on virt) keeps the grant path and its recyclers; that is the last
  `fpr_grow_memory` user.
* **Message slabs are packed.**  `send` deep-copies into the SENDER'S
  message slab (64 KiB, the buddy's floor) until it is full, then
  starts another; a message too big for a fresh one gets a slab of its
  own.  A slab's lifetime is two counts under `arc_lock`: `escaped`
  (promoted roots still live) and `holds` -- the sender while it is
  still packing, plus one per DROP of a root in the slab, held until
  that dropper's next receive (its borrow window: the compiler's
  `drop m` lands right after the destructure while the arm still
  reads the children; `fpr_drop_park`).  Every drop takes a hold, not
  only the last escapee's -- with many messages in one slab, an
  earlier dropper's window is still open when the last root goes,
  and the first cut freed the slab under it (POS v1 died on a string
  that was no longer one).  The slab goes home when both counts are
  zero.  Three thousand forty-byte tuples in flight cost a few slabs,
  not 750 MiB, and a stream of sends costs one block per 64 KiB, not
  per send.  tests/msgpack.fpr is the contract: four producers, a
  hub that verifies after its autodrop and relays by sendLinear, a
  sink that verifies again, churners dying underneath.
* **Per-actor pool.** An actor's blocks become a bump slab chain plus
  two recycling tiers, both exact-fit: the size-class buckets below
  the 8 KiB ceiling and the bigfree LIFO above it.  Death returns the
  chain wholesale -- an actor's memory lifetime IS the actor's
  lifetime.  Long-lived actors `Sys.poolReset` at loop boundaries.
  `fpr_realloc` is the pool's third op: copy-based, with the freed
  predecessor recycling exactly, so a doubling ladder reuses its own
  history. **[pending: in-place growth for bulk storage arrives when
  columns sit on the buddy directly, where buddy_realloc provides it]**
* **The ledger.**  `Sys.memInfo 0` is `[arena KiB, free KiB,
  queued requests, waits, direct, frees, denied, inline]`;
  `Sys.growLog` still attributes every block to its site (slab, msg,
  stack, ...).
  tests/memory.fpr is the contract: two hundred workers come and go
  and the free space is back within the permanent residue (acbs,
  channel blocks, the ARC table), with the requests served by the
  actor and none denied -- on qosp and on the bare-metal kernel.
* Nothing else. A recycler that is not one of the two named above, a
  pool tier, or buddy itself is debt.

## App images: many processes, one runtime (Memory.qa stage 2)

With the memory actor owning the arena, a second app image is just
more actors on the same plane: `LD.launch me ld "appa"` (std/
loader.fpr) reads `apps/appa.qa` off the disk, attaches it through the
same host gate every module passes (the shell-stamp check), finds its
`app` export and spawns it under a FRESH pid with `Sys.spawnApp` --
the shell's actors stay pid 0, the app's root gets the next pid and
everything it spawns inherits it (`myPid`, `Sys.actInfo`).  The app's
first message is its launcher's handle; its table is popped straight
back out of the module registry (the registry is the module chain
that hot-swaps gate against; an app is a process, not a binding), and
its code stays in its window.  Nothing is recorded: apps are runtime
state, a reboot starts none of them -- the next step, when it is
wanted, is a `sys/apps` record the loader replays like `sys/live`.
tests/apps.fpr is the contract: two images from one disk, distinct
pids, a helper inheriting its app's pid, both reporting back, and the
free space back where it was once they exit.

What stage 2 does NOT do yet: an app is linked at one of the eight
fixed 4 MiB plugin sub-slots (no relocation), so eight images is the
ceiling and each must be built for a distinct slot; a launched app
shares the shell's capability set (per-pid caps are the next gate);
and isolation is cooperative -- the pid is an accounting label on the
one plane, not an address space.

## Vectors: contiguous, branch-light

A Vector's column is ONE contiguous span (live — the VList block
chain is gone). Growth is `realloc`-by-doubling; `Vec.get`/scan
pointer math is base + i·width, no block walk, no per-index log2.
Every consumer reads the same span: codegen's specialized/RVV loops
stride it as one run, the gfx scene walker and GPU upload lost their
block-walk mirrors.

Conditional operations do not branch per element: `Vec.filter` and
friends write a MASK (branchless predicate evaluation, SIMD-friendly),
scans fuse the mask, and density is restored by an explicit
`Vec.compact` or automatically at `Sys.poolReset` — compaction is a
frame-boundary event, not a per-element decision. **[pending]**

## Concurrency: nothing blocks, nothing spins hot

* An actor that must wait YIELDS (receive, fuel safepoint, and now
  `Sys.sleepUs`: a parked sleep with a deadline on its hart's sleeper
  list, woken by the hart loop — it used to nanosleep the hart
  THREAD on qosp, so every actor sharing that hart waited out the
  sleep; a sleeper is not a deadlock to the detector) — it never
  holds a core.
* Any CAS retry loop backs off EXPONENTIALLY (capped) before trying
  again — contention degrades bandwidth, never livelocks a hart.
  `fpr_lock` implements this today as the transitional form.
* The end-state has no locks at all: each shared structure is owned
  by one actor and mutated only through its mailbox — buddy/grants
  behind Memory.qa, promotion behind ARC.qa, the same argument as the
  linear-resource-owning services. **[pending: the remaining lock
  sites and their owners are inventoried in MEMORY-V2-PLAN.md]**

## The laws (each one paid for already)

* **Drop what you receive.** Every received message root is dropped
  once read — compiler-discharged on the common shapes (autodrop),
  ARC.qa audits backstop the rest (tests/arcaudit.fpr).
* **Frames are structure, not garbage.** Double-buffer bulk data,
  ping-pong by `sendLinear` (consume) / receive (re-own). Lifetime
  is the loop shape; nothing is ever "collected". (tests/frames.fpr:
  199 cross-actor bounces, arcLive delta 0.)
* **A service owns its linear resource.** One actor holds the linear
  handle; the mailbox is the serialization.
* **Copy on retain.** A nested value kept beyond drop-of-root is a
  dangling pointer; the retainer copies into its own pool.
* **Never send live state.** Reply with a disposable copy — or
  `sendLinear` the real thing and stop owning it. There is no third
  option, which is the point.

## What "no GC" buys and costs

Buys: no pauses, no discovery phase, WCET stays compositional (free
is attributed to the operation that caused it), and the scheduler /
fuel model never has to model a collector. Costs: the laws above are
LAWS — the linearity checker enforces regime 1, autodrop discharges
law 1 on the common shapes, and what the compiler cannot prove stays
manual and reported. The v2 point is that the RUNTIME'S side of the
bargain also stays small: two allocators, three ops, three regimes,
and every "clever" mechanism beyond that either becomes one of these
or gets deleted.
