# POS.v1 — Design

**Status:** proposal · **Date:** 2026-09-07 · **Target:** FP-RISC / Sol, MVU on gen_view + Ma, FPRLive for multi-register
**Precedent:** `examples/pos2.sol` (Register / Receipts / Inventory, July 2026)

---

## 1. Intent

A point-of-sale for a single small shop: ring up items, take payment, keep stock and receipts straight, across one or more registers. Small enough that one person can read this doc and the source in an afternoon and trust both.

**Acceptance test.** Someone with a few years of MVU/FP experience reads §2–§6 for ten minutes, copies the example in §9, and has a working register. If any core flow in §3 fails on the documented example under stated assumptions, v1 is not done — regardless of anything else.

**Sizing rule.** v1 stops at the pos2 shape. Anything not in §3 goes to §11 (deferred) or to an experimental branch, and merges only if it proves out.

---

## 2. Invariants

Named up front so the design can be checked against them.

| # | Invariant | Enforced by |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| I1 | A committed sale is immutable. Corrections are new records that reference the original. | append-only log; no `Edit` messages on committed data |
| I2 | Checkout is atomic: stock decrement + receipt + revenue update all land or none do. | one Sol transaction per checkout; crash-atomic commit |
| I3 | The model is the single source of truth; exactly one writer. | model actor (MVU rule) |
| I4 | Every operation has a bounded worst case. | std tier only; capped lists; timeouts + stated backoff on device I/O |
| I5 | Nothing about the UI must be memorised. Every action is visible, named, and means exactly what it says. | syntax⇔semantics; no hidden shortcuts, no modal state that isn't on screen |
| I6 | Red / amber / green carry meaning only. | Ma reserved roles; `badge` takes a role, not a colour |
| I7 | The environment is assumed unreliable: network, peer registers, printer, drawer. | offline-capable register; explicit sync state; reconnect-resume |
| I8 | Prices, tax, catalog, stock are *values*, tweakable live. Model *shape* does not change during iteration. | value-space-over-type-space; admin view is a reified data console |

---

## 3. Scope (v1)

Three tabs, one login. Exactly pos2, tightened.

**Register**
- Product cards (`cardGrid`) with price and stock badge.
- Cart: grouped lines, qty ±, remove, running subtotal / tax / total.
- Checkout: one action. Payment kind = `Cash | Card`. Cash shows change due.
- Toast on success; the cart clears; the receipt is in Receipts.

**Receipts**
- Table of committed sales: number, cashier, items, total, time.
- Open a receipt → line detail.
- **Void** = new record `Void n` referencing receipt *n*; stock returns. The original row is unchanged and shows a `void` badge (danger role). (I1)

**Inventory**
- Table: product, price, stock, restock action.
- Restock = new `Restock k delta` record. (I1)
- Low-stock threshold per product; below it the badge is the warning role. (I6)

**Login**
- Cashier name + PIN. Cashier is stamped on every sale/void/restock.

**Admin (secondary surface, off the main path)**
- Reified data console over the model: view/set price, tax rate, threshold, add/retire product. Small query/setter language, watch list overlay. Not a debugger — a live data model. (I8)

Everything else: §11.

## 4. Model

One record, kept flat, fields named as they appear on screen (I5).

```
Model = {
  cashier   : String            -- "" = logged out
  tab       : Tab               -- Register | Receipts | Inventory | Admin
  catalog   : Persistent (Vec Product)
  stock     : Persistent (Vec Int)         -- index-aligned with catalog
  cart      : List CartLine                -- volatile, per register
  sales     : Persistent (Log SaleEvent)   -- append-only
  taxRate   : Persistent Numeric
  lowAt     : Persistent Int
  sync      : Sync                         -- Online | Offline n   (n = unsynced events)
  toast     : Maybe String
}

Product   = { name : String, price : Numeric, sku : String }
CartLine  = { sku : String, qty : Int }
SaleEvent = Sale    { n : Int, cashier, lines : List CartLine, total, pay : Pay, at : Time }
          | Void    { n : Int, refs : Int, cashier, at }
          | Restock { sku, delta : Int, cashier, at }
Pay       = Cash Numeric | Card
```

Derived, never stored: `subtotal`, `tax`, `total`, `revenue`, `changeDue`, current stock = `fold` over `sales` if you ever need to rebuild `stock` (the log is authoritative; `stock` is a cache — see §7).

Client locals (Alpine-style, in the tree, not in the model): active tab hover, qty stepper before commit, receipt row expanded/collapsed. Zero round trips.

---

## 5. Messages

One head-clause per message in `update`, guards for validation, pipelines for list transforms (STYLE.md). No message mutates a committed `SaleEvent`.

```
Msg = Login String String
    | Logout
    | SetTab Tab
    | AddToCart String            -- sku
    | SetQty String Int           -- sku, absolute qty (0 = remove)
    | Checkout Pay
    | VoidSale Int
    | Restock String Int
    | AdminSet Path Value         -- I8; Path is the string-path→lens form
    | SyncTick                    -- from Cmd, bounded
    | DismissToast
```

Guards that reject rather than silently fix (I5):
- `Checkout` with empty cart, or any line where `qty > stock` → no-op + toast (warning role).
- `VoidSale n` where `n` already voided → no-op + toast.
- `SetQty` clamps to `[0, stock]` and says so.

`Checkout` is the one message whose handler is a **transaction** (§7).

---

## 6. View

`view : Model -> Scene2D` built from Ma components on gen_view. Stacks only; no grid; no z-index (tree order).

```
page
 ├─ navBar [brand, tabs (chip per Tab), spacer, syncBadge, cashier, logout]
 └─ body
     Register:   hstack [ cardGrid(product card ×N) | vstack [cart, totals, checkout] ]
     Receipts:   vstack [ header(count, revenue), table(receipt row ×N, capped), detail? ]
     Inventory:  vstack [ header, table(product, price, stockBadge, restock chip) ]
     Admin:      vstack [ watchList, queryBox, setBox ]
 └─ toast?
```

**Static / dynamic split.** Tab skeletons, nav, table headers, card frames are statics. Totals, stock numbers, cart lines, badge roles, sync state are dynamic slots. Theme (day/night) lives in statics on purpose so the reshape path is exercised.

**Ma tokens in use** (only these are emitted — stylesheet is a function of the view):
`bg-surface bg-raised tx-1 tx-2 tx-muted r-md sh-sm gap-2 gap-4 p-4 t-display t-body t-mono`
Roles: `danger` (void, stock 0), `warning` (low stock, rejected action), `success` (sale committed), `celebrate` (first sale of the day only — otherwise `success`).

**Ma (empty space).** Cart panel has fixed width and reserved vertical slack; a 40-line cart scrolls inside it rather than pushing the checkout button off-screen. Card grid wraps; never shrinks cards.

**Night theme** is one class on the page root; a toggle in nav. Default follows a `theme` config field, not the OS.

---

## 7. Persistence and transactions

- `sales` is an append-only `Log`, the git-without-a-filesystem shape: deltas + pointer list, compacted incrementally. It is the authoritative record. (I1)
- `stock`, `catalog`, `taxRate`, `lowAt` are `Persistent` fields with the **autooptimise** profile (in-memory cache, more reads than writes). `sales` uses a write-heavy profile: append, don't rewrite.
- `Checkout pay`: snapshot `stock` and `cart`, validate, append `Sale`, decrement `stock`, clear `cart` — all inside one transaction. Validation failure re-runs; a crash mid-commit leaves either everything or nothing (journal + rename-atomic writes). (I2)
- `stock` can be rebuilt from `sales` by a fold; an admin `rebuildStock` action exists for the day the cache and log disagree. That the log wins is stated in the doc, not discovered.

Open: the `Persistent a` representation (per-field constructors vs one constructor + options record) is undecided. Criterion is "simplest for the MVU backend to pattern-match." v1 picks **one constructor + options record** by the Sep 2 rule (Pareto-set, pick one, stick with it) and re-visits only if the backend fights it.

---

## 8. Multi-register (FPRLive)

- Each register is an FPRLive client; the model actor runs on the shop server (single writer, I3).
- Per-connection volatile state (`cart`, `tab`, `cashier`) is per-session; `sales`, `stock`, `catalog` are shared.
- Reconnect-resume via the existing sequence-gap resync; on disconnect the register shows `Offline n` in nav (warning role) and continues to ring up; queued events replay in order on reconnect; a conflicting checkout (stock went to 0 elsewhere) is rejected on replay with a toast naming the receipt. (I7)
- `SyncTick` is a `Cmd` with exponential backoff and a stated cap — it is std-tier, never core. (I4)

---

## 9. Example (must work as pasted)

```
pos = use "std.pos" .
> MVU.serve { port = 8084, persist = "./pos.log", theme = Day }
             pos.init pos.update pos.view .
```

Open `http://localhost:8084`, log in as `ana / 1234`, add two items, `Checkout (Cash 50)`, see the toast and the receipt. Void it. Stock returns. Restart the process; the receipt and void are still there.

---

## 10. Testing (adversarial, not happy-path)

Sweep leg `tests/pos/`:
1. **Last unit race** — two sessions checkout the same last item; exactly one commits, the other gets the rejection toast.
2. **Crash windows** — `SOL_CRASH_AT=n` across the checkout commit; after restart the log is either complete or absent, `stock` matches a rebuild.
3. **Void twice** — second void rejected; original row still shows one `void` badge.
4. **Offline replay** — kill the socket mid-cart, ring three sales, reconnect; three receipts, correct numbering, one conflict handled.
5. **Bounded lists** — 10k receipts; Receipts tab renders the capped page, memory flat (`arcLive` flat).
6. **Delta correctness** — steady-state cart edits produce slot deltas, not full re-renders; theme flip is the one reshape.
7. **Log vs cache** — corrupt `stock`, run `rebuildStock`, equals fold over `sales`.

---

## 11. Not in v1 (deferred, filed here so they aren't in the reading path)

- Discounts, bundles, loyalty, tax exemptions. If ever added: **one** composable price-modifier primitive, not four features. Their intersection is where undocumented behaviour lives.
- Receipt printer / cash-drawer kick. Realtime escape, fired **after** commit, one marked call site. Not in v1.
- Card terminal integration. Bounded I/O in std; not in v1 (`Card` is recorded, not processed).
- Multiple shops / tenants.
- Reports beyond count + all-time revenue.
- Any plugin, hook, or config DSL. Custom behaviour is Sol code in the same MVU. One mental model.
- Editing a committed receipt. Never.

---

## 12. Platform notes and edge cases (appendix)

- Hosted profile (`fpr sol`) for the shop server; QOS Native possible later via `std.MVU` — same `init/update/view`.
- Sol strings: use `BStr` for receipt rendering if the Receipts page ever builds large text; `VStr` is fine for v1 caps.
- No float literals: tax rate is `Numeric.div 10 100`.
- Every block statement must bind; `> print "x" .` not `> u = print "x" .`
- pos2 gotchas already fixed upstream: exponential clause desugar, WebSocket UTF-8 truncation, `sh` type. Don't re-test for them here.
- Pin: this doc corresponds to `fpr commit` of `std.pos` v1.0; a breaking model change is a `--major` bump and a new doc.
