# The dungeon: a Java OOP crawler translated into FP-RISC

`fp-risc/programs/dungeon.fpr` is [hyperswine/dungeon_game](https://github.com/hyperswine/dungeon_game)
-- a 2D JavaFX turn-based crawler -- remade as one MVU program on QOS's
GLES walker: a top-down board under an angled camera that follows the
player, with the original's mechanics kept and its OOP structure gone.

    ./qos.py run programs/dungeon.fpr        # a window (qosp-gl, GLFW)
    qos/tests-host/dungeon-check.sh          # a scripted game, played to a win under Xvfb
    make qos-app PROG=tests/dungeon.fpr && (cd ../qos && ./qosp --yes ../fp-risc/app.qa)

## The translation

The Java is a textbook pattern exercise: an `Entity` inheritance tree, a
`CombatStrategy`, `CombatDecorator` wrappers, a `GoalComposite`, JavaFX
`BooleanProperty` fields with change listeners, and a mutable `Dungeon`
the controllers reach into.  None of it survives a language where the
model is one immutable value, and that is the point -- most of those
patterns exist to simulate, in an object graph, something a functional
language already has.

| Java | FP-RISC | why the pattern disappears |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Entity` subclasses (`Wall`, `Boulder`, `Door`, `Portal`, `Treasure`, ...) | one `Th` sum type; `Ob kind x y` on a list | behaviour is a `case` in a pure function, so there is no vtable to inherit |
| `CombatStrategy` (strategy) | `stanceOf m : Model -> Stance` | the strategy IS a function of state; storing which one is "installed" is storing a derivable fact |
| `CombatDecorator` (decorator chain) | `statsOf m : Model -> (dmg, taken, radius)` | wrapping to accumulate modifiers is a fold; write the fold |
| `GoalComposite` / `GoalType.AND`/`OR` | `Goal = GExit \| GEnemies \| GBoulders \| GTreasure \| GAll [Goal] \| GAny [Goal]` + `goalMet` | the composite pattern is an algebraic data type with a recursive `case` -- this is the one the pattern was imitating most directly |
| `BooleanProperty` + change listeners | derived from the model in `view` every frame | a value that is a function of state is never stored, so it cannot go stale, and there is no listener to forget to unregister |
| mutable `Dungeon` + `DungeonProbe` | `key : Model -> Int -> Model`, `atOf`/`hasKind`/`blocked` folds | a turn is a function; probing is reading |
| four controllers | MVU `update` + `subs` | one place decides what an event does |
| A\* re-run per enemy per move | one BFS from the player each enemy turn (`bestStep`) | every enemy reads its optimal step off the same field; while the player is invincible they read it backwards and flee |

What is kept: walls; boulders pushed onto floor switches; doors that open
only to a matching key; portal pairs; treasure; a sword with five swings;
an invincibility potion that makes contact lethal and sends the enemies
running; a nuke that clears its neighbourhood; a taunt; the exit; enemies
that pursue on every second player turn; and the AND/OR goal tree over
exit / enemies / boulders / treasure.

What is assumed: sprites become solids (the walker's cube, sphere, disc
and coin), the level is built in code (`level0`, 19x13 characters), and
the hyper-scroll, the dungeon-pass, sound and the level editor are out.

## The shape

* **`programs/mods/dungeonrules.fpr`** -- the rules, and nothing else: no
  `print`, no service, no colour.  A turn is `key : Model -> Int ->
  Model`; the board, the stances, the goal fold and the enemy AI all live
  here.  It has no import but the prelude.
* **`programs/dungeon.fpr`** -- the shell: the MVU four, the 3D scene
  (`Ent mesh pos yaw scale colour` per tile, wall, object and enemy), the
  angled camera, and the scene2d HUD.  It is also the only thing that
  speaks: `announce` prints a line whenever the model's recorded message
  changes, which is the game's transcript and what the headless check
  reads.
* **`tests/dungeon.fpr`** -- 34 assertions over the rules, headless.

Keys are buffered on the model and one is taken per tick (`take`), the
same discipline as Terra II: it gives the camera frames to ease over, and
it makes a replayed key file play back as a game rather than resolve into
a single blur of state.  The whole game is deterministic -- no clock, no
randomness -- so `dungeon-check.sh`'s key file plays the same game on
every machine, down to the turn count in the win banner.

## Why the rules are a separate module

Because a turn is a pure function, a game is a fold:

```
play m Nil = m.
play m (k :: r) = play (R.key m k) r.
```

`tests/dungeon.fpr` is that fold with assertions between the moves: the
board parses back as it was written, walking over treasure takes it, the
sword changes `stanceOf` and therefore `statsOf`, a boulder heaved north
lands on the switch, a door refuses an empty bag and opens to its own
key, the potion is six turns of `Untouchable`, the nuke clears radius 1,
enemies close on you and flee while you glow, the goal tree folds to
seven checklist lines, a portal moves you to its twin, and hit points
running out turns the screen.  No GPU, no window, no frame loop.  The
Java original needed a JavaFX stage and four controllers to check the
same things.

Isolating a mechanic is one field of a record:

```
quiet = quietOf fresh.
quietOf m = { m | ens = Nil }.
```

-- the boulder and door tests run on a board with nobody hunting you, so
a wandering enemy standing in the corridor cannot make the script flaky.

## The look

Every colour on both layers is MILLI (0..1000), not 0..255 -- the first
cut wrote bytes and the dungeon came out black.  The floor is a checker
so movement is legible; walls are a cube plus a lighter cap; objects are
the walker's primitives (a sphere for a boulder, a coin for treasure, a
disc for a switch, a slab for a door).  The camera is a fixed pitch with
no rotation -- the "top-down 3D" of the brief -- easing a sixth of the
way to the player each tick and clamped to the board so standing in a
corner does not fill half the screen with the void outside the level.
On the title, won and lost screens the same rig pulls back onto the
board's centre, so the level you just walked is what is behind the words.

## The check

`qos/tests-host/dungeon-check.sh` builds the .qa and `qosp-gl`, replays a
fixed evdev key file under `xvfb-run` and asserts the transcript: the
treasure, the sword, an enemy killed with it, both boulders heaved onto
their switches, key 2 found and its door unlocked, the nuke used on the
enemy that followed us through, a portal traversal, and

    [dungeon] WON in 70 turns: 1 treasure, 0 enemies left

-- the goal tree satisfied by its "no enemies left, then the exit" arm.
Then the 960x600 PPM snapshots the P key read back, none of them blank.
A second leg walks into an enemy bare-handed and holds still against a
boulder until it bites through five hit points, for the death screen.
