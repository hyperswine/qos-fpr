# Terra II — Card Game V1

*A playable first cut. Derived from the Design Aggregation (§11, §14, §15) plus the Sep 2026 deck-structure discussion. Where V1 deviates from the settled design, it says so and why — nothing here supersedes the aggregation, it just picks what to build first.*

---

## 0. What V1 is for

V1 exists to answer one question at the table: **does the positional economy bite?** After a game, the losing player should be talking about a convoy they left exposed or a lane they let open — not about draw luck or stat lines. Everything kept below serves that test; everything cut would blur it.

Four ideas carry the game's identity and are non-negotiable in V1:

1. **Supply is earned, not given.** It comes from units on the board and can be taken away.
2. **The rear is valuable and protected.** Cover is a geometric rule, not a keyword.
3. **Information is incomplete.** Face-down ambush cards are the single information system.
4. **Disengaging costs tempo.** You can't pull a damaged unit to hand for free.

---

## 1. Scope decisions

### 1.1 Kept from the settled design

| Element | V1 form |
|---|---|
| Forward / Rear zones, 5 slots each, forward face-up only | As settled |
| Board-derived supply from rear units | As settled, integer scale |
| Cover rule + artillery as the rear-strike tool | As settled |
| Attack / Overwatch modes, 50% intercept | As settled |
| Face-down rear ambush | As settled, single reveal condition |
| CALL / RETREAT / RECALL | As settled |
| Stat block ATK / DEF / AP / MP / CALL / DRAIN | Printed in full; MP reserved (see §4) |
| Multiplicative modifiers only, no binary states | As settled |
| ENV track | Tier 1 only |
| Universal veterancy +1/+1 per 3 turns | As settled |
| HQ destruction as win condition | As settled |
| Faction-locked cards, no neutrals, no crossover | As settled |
| Unit type tags | Soft / Hard / Structure / Organic / Synthetic only |

### 1.2 V1 deviations from the aggregation (deliberate, revisit in V2)

| Settled | V1 | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Three zones (Forward / Mid / Rear) | **Two zones (Forward / Rear)** | Mid only earns its place once MP-driven movement exists. Two zones test cover, lanes, and ambush with less to adjudicate. |
| Four draw decks | **One 40-card deck** | Per Sep 4 discussion. Split decks make convoy draws guaranteed, which removes the logistics-ratio decision from deckbuilding. Copy limits give the draw guarantee instead (§8). |
| Supply as 0–100% with +10% tokens | **Integer 0–10 tokens** | Identical information, no percent arithmetic at the table. |
| ENV tiers 1 and 2 | **Tier 1 only** | Neutral mob spawning is a second actor on the board. Get the two-player economy right first. |
| Shared centre strip with Phase Card | **No orbital phase** | Global modifiers every N turns add bookkeeping without testing the core loop. Reintroduce as a shared event deck. |
| 2× damage in home zones | **Omitted** | Rule needs a clearer definition before it's tested. |
| Effect tiers 1–3 | **Tiers 1–2, plus four fixed behaviours** | Continuous auras and parametric modifiers only. The only reactive behaviours are overwatch, ambush, Last Stand, and Breakthrough. No activated effects beyond artillery charge. |
| Trap cards (uncertain) | **Cut** | Ambush covers the hidden-information role. |
| Eight factions | **Two: Republic VI, Southern Empire** | One balanced, one aggressive. Enough to prove asymmetry and the per-faction credit curve. |

---

## 2. Components

- 2 × 40-card faction decks
- 2 × HQ cards
- 20 supply tokens (10 per player)
- 1 ENV track card (0–10) with a marker
- ~12 veterancy dice or small tokens
- 10 mode markers (Attack / Overwatch) — or just rotate the card 90° for Overwatch
- Damage counters (dice on cards are fine)

---

## 3. Board

```
                 ENV track (shared)

 P2  HQ
 P2  Rear     [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
 P2  Forward  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
 ─────────────────────────────────
 P1  Forward  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
 P1  Rear     [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
 P1  HQ
```

**Columns matter.** Forward slot *n* covers rear slot *n*. Attacks reach the same column or one column either side (±1). A **lane** is a column where both a player's forward and rear slots are empty; lanes expose the HQ.

**Forward zone:** face-up combat units only. Each is in Attack or Overwatch mode.
**Rear zone:** face-up support units, or face-down ambush cards.
**HQ:** a fixed card. DEF 15, generates 2 supply, cannot move, cannot be retreated. It is not a unit and has no tags.

| Stat | Meaning in V1 |
|---|---|
| **ATK** | Damage dealt per attack |
| **DEF** | Hit points. Damage is persistent; unit is destroyed at 0 |
| **AP** | Actions per turn. Spent on attack, entering Overwatch, or charging artillery. Always 1 in V1 |
| **MP** | Printed but unused in V1. Reserved for the Mid zone |
| **CALL** | Supply cost to deploy from hand |
| **DRAIN** | Upkeep. Paid every turn the unit is on the board |
| **GEN** | (Support units only) Supply generated per turn |

**Type tags:** Soft, Hard, Structure, Organic, Synthetic. Two or three per card. In V1 only *Soft* has a rule attached (ENV damage). The rest are printed so effects can target them later.

**Modifiers** are always multiplicative and rounded down. Two 50% modifiers stack to 25%. Nothing sets a stat to zero or grants immunity.

---

## 5. Turn structure

Players alternate. Each turn:

1. **Ready** — un-exhaust your units. Any face-down ambush placed last turn becomes *ready*. Advance veterancy counters.
2. **Supply** — compute your **rate**: HQ GEN + GEN of every face-up rear support unit. Subtract total DRAIN. Add the result to your stockpile, **capped at 3 carried over from the previous turn** (you can never hold more than 3 + this turn's net rate).
   If net rate is negative, you must mark units *Unsupplied* (ATK 50%) until DRAIN ≤ rate. Choose which.
3. **Draw** — draw 1. Optionally redraw or requisition (§9).
4. **Deploy** — spend supply to CALL cards. Place forward units in Attack mode. Place rear units face-up, or place any unit face-down in the rear for CALL −1 (min 1).
5. **Act** — each unit may spend its AP: attack, enter Overwatch, or charge. RETREAT / RECALL happen here too.
6. **End** — ENV effects resolve (§10). Discard down to 7 cards.

Turn 1 for the first player skips the Act phase.

---

## 6. Supply

Supply is a **rate you maintain**, not a pool you hoard. The 3-token carry cap enforces this: you can smooth over one bad turn, not bank for a bomb.

- HQ generates 2. A player with no rear support units is running on HQ alone and will not afford anything above CALL 3 while paying any DRAIN.
- Support units in the rear generate GEN. They are the reason the rear zone exists.
- DRAIN is paid before the stockpile is touched. Heavy units cost you every turn whether or not you use them.
- Losing a convoy is losing a turn of tempo for the rest of the game. That is the intended feeling.

---

## 7. Movement: CALL, RETREAT, RECALL

- **CALL** — pay CALL cost, place from hand. Forward units enter in Attack mode and cannot act the turn they're called. Support units enter the rear and generate next turn.
- **RETREAT** — a forward unit spends its AP to move to an empty rear slot in the same column. It keeps its damage. A retreated combat unit generates nothing and cannot attack from the rear.
- **REPAIR** — at the start of your turn, a combat unit in your rear recovers 2 DEF if a friendly Engineering/Repair unit is in the rear, otherwise 1.
- **RECALL** — a rear unit at full DEF may return to hand for free during Deploy. Veterancy is lost.
- **Advance** — a combat unit in the rear may spend its AP to move to the empty forward slot in its column.

A damaged unit therefore costs at least three turns (retreat, repair, recall or advance) to preserve. Sometimes the right call is to let it die.

---

## 8. Combat

### 8.1 Attack mode
A forward unit in Attack mode spends AP to attack one target within ±1 column:

- an enemy **forward** unit; or
- an enemy **rear** unit whose covering forward slot is **empty**; or
- the enemy **HQ**, if a **lane** (forward and rear both empty) exists within ±1 of the attacker.

Damage = ATK × modifiers. No retaliation: the defender doesn't strike back unless it is in Overwatch or is a revealed ambush.

### 8.2 Overwatch
Spend AP to enter Overwatch (rotate the card). While in Overwatch a unit cannot attack. When an enemy unit attacks any friendly unit or HQ in a column within ±1 of the overwatching unit, it **intercepts**: it deals **50% ATK** to the attacker before the attack resolves. Once per enemy turn. If the attacker dies, the attack doesn't happen.

Overwatch ends when the unit attacks, retreats, or is destroyed.

### 8.3 Cover
A rear unit whose column's forward slot is occupied by a friendly unit cannot be targeted by normal attacks. Overwatch does *not* provide cover to adjacent columns — only the same column counts. A cheap forward unit's job is often just to stand in front of a convoy.

### 8.4 Artillery
Units tagged **Artillery** ignore cover and may target any enemy rear unit or the HQ regardless of lanes, in any column. To fire, spend AP on one turn to **charge** (mark it), then spend AP on a later turn to fire. Charge is lost if the unit retreats or is damaged. Artillery has low DEF and cannot enter Overwatch.

### 8.5 Ambush
A face-down rear card becomes **ready** at the start of your next turn. While ready, if an enemy unit attacks the forward unit in the ambush's column, or attacks the ambush card itself, you may **reveal**: the ambush deals full ATK to the attacker *before* the attack resolves, then stays face-up in the rear (it can advance later). Reveal is optional — a bluff is a legal play. A face-down card destroyed before it is ready is simply discarded.

Only one reveal condition exists in V1. Do not add scouting until this one has been tested.

---

## 9. Draw, redraw, requisition

- **Opening hand:** 5 cards. One free mulligan (shuffle back, draw 5). No supply cost.
- **Redraw:** during Draw, pay 1 supply to discard one card and draw one. Once per turn.
- **Requisition:** during Draw, pay 3 supply to shuffle your hand into your deck and draw the same number. Once per game.
- **Deck-out:** if you must draw from an empty deck, take 2 damage to HQ instead.

Redraws come out of the same supply you'd spend on units, so the player who most needs one can least afford it. That is correct for this setting.

---

## 10. ENV track

A shared 0–10 counter. It only goes up.

- When a unit is destroyed, ENV rises by 1 for Soft units, 2 for Hard or Structure.
- **ENV 4+:** at each player's End phase, every **Soft** unit that player controls takes 1 damage.
- **ENV 7+:** additionally, each HQ generates 1 less supply.
- **ENV 10:** additionally, every unit takes 1 damage at End.

Tier 2 (neutral mob spawning) is out of V1. The track's job here is to guarantee games end and to make attrition trades progressively worse for whoever has the softer army.

---

## 11. Veterancy

Every combat unit that has survived 3 full turns on the board gains one **VET** token: +1 ATK, +1 DEF (raises current DEF too). Then again every 3 turns. Track with a die on the card. VET is lost on RECALL. Faction cards may modify the rate (Veteran Assault Squad, §13.2).

---

## 12. Win condition

Reduce the enemy HQ to 0 DEF. Nothing else wins. Zone control matters only because it opens lanes and kills convoys.

---

## 13. Deck construction

- Exactly 40 cards, one faction.
- Copy limits are set by CALL cost, no exceptions:

| CALL | Max copies |
|---|---|
| 1–2 | 3 |
| 3–4 | 2 |
| 5+ | 1 |

- **Logistics floor:** a deck must contain at least 8 cards with GEN ≥ 1. With 8 in 40, the chance of seeing at least one supply source in the opening 5 plus the first draw is about 76%; with 9 it is about 81%, with 10 about 85% (with only 5, it drops to 58%). The free mulligan covers most of the remainder, the 1-supply redraw the rest. Tune this number first if games are stalling on economy.
- **Artillery ceiling:** at most 3 artillery cards. This is the dial for when the cover rule stops mattering (see §15).

---

## 14. V1 factions

Both decks are 40 cards. Every card is faction-locked. Stats are first-pass numbers for the table, not tuned.

### 14.1 Republic VI — "Institutional redundancy"

Balanced, resilient, wins by attrition through repair and auras. Its credit curve front-loads cheap durable infantry; it pays for that with an unremarkable top end.

**Support (10)**

| # | Card | CALL | GEN | DEF | DRAIN | Tags | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Mobile Convoy MkII | 2 | 1 | 4 | 0 | Structure, Hard | — |
| 2 | Field Depot | 3 | 2 | 5 | 0 | Structure, Hard | — |
| 2 | Engineering Corps | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Repair: friendly rear units recover 2 DEF instead of 1. |
| 3 | Civil Registry | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | Structure | While face-up in rear, your Redraw costs 0. |

**Infantry (16)**

| # | Card | CALL | ATK | DEF | DRAIN | Tags | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Republic Conscript | 1 | 1 | 3 | 0 | Soft, Organic | — |
| 3 | Civil Defence Corps | 2 | 2 | 3 | 0 | Soft, Organic | +1 DEF while a friendly Structure is in the same column. |
| 3 | Field Medic | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 | Soft, Organic | At your Ready phase, adjacent friendly units recover 1 DEF. |
| 3 | Light Infantry | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | Soft, Organic | May Advance and attack in the same turn (costs 1 AP total). |
| 2 | Republic Guard | 3 | 2 | 4 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Rally: adjacent friendly units +1 DEF. |
| 2 | Recon Section | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Soft, Organic | When called, look at one face-down enemy rear card. |

**Heavy (8)**

| # | Card | CALL | ATK | DEF | DRAIN | Tags | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | Mechanised Infantry | 3 | 3 | 4 | 1 | Hard, Organic | — |
| 2 | Combined Arms Battalion | 4 | 4 | 5 | 1 | Hard, Organic | Overwatch intercept deals 100% ATK instead of 50%. |
| 2 | Coilgun Battery | 4 | 4 | 2 | 1 | Hard, Artillery | Artillery. |
| 1 | Strategic Air Wing | 5 | 3 | 3 | 1 | Hard, Synthetic | Ignores ±1 column limit; may target any forward unit. |
| 1 | **Commander Jake** | 5 | 2 | 5 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Adjacent friendly units ignore ENV damage. |

**Tactics (6)**

| # | Card | CALL | Text |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Rally Point | 1 | Target friendly forward unit enters Overwatch without spending AP. |
| 2 | Civic Levy | 2 | Gain 1 supply per friendly Structure in your rear (max 3). |
| 1 | Evacuation Order | 2 | Move a friendly forward unit to any empty rear slot; it recovers 2 DEF. |

Total: 10 + 16 + 8 + 6 = **40**. GEN ≥ 1 cards: 5 (short of the floor — see note below).

> **Note:** Republic VI as listed has only 5 supply generators. This is intentional pressure on the number: the deck leans on Field Depot's GEN 2 and Civic Levy bursts. If playtests show Republic stalling, raise Mobile Convoy to CALL 1 and cut Civil Registry to reach 8 generators. That's the first thing to check.

### 14.2 Southern Empire — "Peace is decline"

Aggressive, veterancy-scaling, its economy literally depends on killing things. Its credit curve front-loads ATK and back-loads DEF; it is cheaper to kill and more expensive to stop.

**Support (9)**

| # | Card | CALL | GEN | DEF | DRAIN | Tags | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Forward Depot | 2 | 1 | 3 | 0 | Structure, Hard | — |
| 2 | War Industry Depot | 4 | 1 | 5 | 0 | Structure, Hard | +1 GEN this turn for each enemy unit destroyed by your units last turn (max +3). |
| 2 | Salvage Crew | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 | Soft, Organic | When an enemy Hard unit is destroyed, gain 1 supply. |
| 2 | Exploitation Post | 3 | 2 | 2 | 0 | Structure | Generates 2 only while you control a forward unit in the same column; otherwise 0. |

**Infantry (16)**

| # | Card | CALL | ATK | DEF | DRAIN | Tags | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Conscript Levy | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | Soft, Organic | — |
| 3 | Ironclad Infantry | 2 | 2 | 4 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Last Stand: ATK ×2 while DEF ≤ 2. |
| 3 | Veteran Assault Squad | 2 | 3 | 2 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Gains VET every 2 turns instead of 3. |
| 3 | Grenadier Corps | 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Breakthrough: if this destroys a forward unit, it may attack once more this turn (±1 column). |
| 2 | Storm Battalion | 3 | 3 | 2 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Not intercepted by Overwatch. |
| 2 | Field Commissar | 2 | 1 | 3 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Adjacent friendly units +1 ATK. |

**Heavy (9)**

| # | Card | CALL | ATK | DEF | DRAIN | Tags | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | Assault Gun | 3 | 4 | 3 | 1 | Hard, Synthetic | — |
| 2 | Railgun Battery | 4 | 5 | 2 | 1 | Hard, Artillery | Artillery. |
| 2 | Iron Column | 4 | 4 | 6 | 1 | Hard, Synthetic | Cannot Retreat. |
| 1 | Heavy Armour Division | 5 | 5 | 7 | 2 | Hard, Synthetic | Hammer Strike: when this attacks, one adjacent friendly unit in Attack mode may attack the same target without spending AP. |
| 1 | **Lt. Maximillan** | 5 | 3 | 4 | 0 | Soft, Organic | Operational Tempo: at your Ready phase, if you destroyed an enemy unit last turn, adjacent friendly units gain VET. |
| 1 | The Executors | 5 | 4 | 4 | 0 | Soft, Organic | May only be called if you control 2+ units with VET. Enters with 2 VET. |

**Tactics (6)**

| # | Card | CALL | Text |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Forced March | 1 | Target friendly forward unit called this turn may act this turn. |
| 2 | Scorched Ground | 2 | Destroy a friendly Structure in your rear. Gain supply equal to its CALL. ENV +2. |
| 1 | The Math Was Correct | 3 | Destroy one friendly unit. Deal its ATK as damage to any enemy unit in the same column, ignoring cover. |

Total: 9 + 16 + 9 + 6 = **40**. GEN ≥ 1 cards: 7, plus Salvage Crew and War Industry as conditional income.

---

## 15. What to measure in playtesting

Track these across the first 10–15 games. Each maps to a single dial.

| Metric | Target | Dial if off |
|---|---|---|
| Game length | 8–12 turns | ENV thresholds, HQ DEF |
| Turn of first artillery fire | 4–7 | Artillery CALL, copy count (≤3 ceiling) |
| Turns where a player had 0 supply after DRAIN | rare, not never | Carry cap, DRAIN on heavies |
| % of losses attributed by the loser to a positional error | high | If low: raise convoy GEN, lower artillery cost |
| Games decided by draw luck (loser's own account) | low | Logistics floor, redraw cost |
| Ambush reveals per game | 1–3 | If 0: lower face-down discount; if 4+: raise it |
| Overwatch entries per game | 3–6 | If 0: raise intercept to 75%; if constant: lower to 33% |
| Republic VI vs S. Empire win rate | 40–60% either way | Per-faction credit curve, not individual cards |

The most important number is the artillery one. If it reliably fires before turn 4, the cover rule stops mattering. If it reliably fires after turn 8, the rear is untouchable and the game degenerates into forward-line attrition.

---

## 16. Roadmap: V1 → V2

In rough priority order, each gated on V1 answering its question first:

1. **Mid zone + MP** — once two-zone positioning has been validated. This is where the settled three-zone design and the AP/MP split come back in.
2. **Four-deck draw system** — if the single deck proves that logistics-ratio decisions are shallow rather than deep. Otherwise leave it.
3. **ENV tier 2** — neutral mobs in free zones. Needs the ENV rate from V1 games to know how fast tier 2 should arrive.
4. **Orbital phase card** — shared event deck, UV High / Snowball. Gated on ENV being tuned.
5. **Third and fourth factions** — Junkers (utility-decay curve) and Thieves (information-heavy, will need the scout action). Hiveform, Robos, Golems, Angels each need a subsystem and come last.
6. **2× home-zone damage** — define it, then test it.
7. **Behavioural effects tier 3** — triggered/activated effects beyond the four fixed ones, using the `[QueuedEffect]` architecture from the engine.
