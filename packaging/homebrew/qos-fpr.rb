# qos-fpr.rb -- the Homebrew formula (macOS and Linux).
#
# Lives in a tap (hyperswine/homebrew-tap: Formula/qos-fpr.rb); this copy
# is the source of truth the tap is updated from on each release.  The
# formula does ONE thing after the dependencies: `./qos.py install
# --prefix`, which is also what a checkout runs for itself -- so the
# layout brew ships is the layout install-check.sh tests.
#
#   brew tap hyperswine/tap && brew install qos-fpr
#   brew install --build-from-source ./packaging/homebrew/qos-fpr.rb
#
# What lands: bin/fpr (the compiler + the sol VM), bin/sol (fpr sol),
# bin/qos (qos.py), and libexec/qos-fpr/ with the std, the HAL, the
# QOS host sources and the prebuilt qosp[-gl] -- see docs/INSTALL.md.

      Every run writes to the directory you invoke from (.qos/ and dist/),
      never to the installed tree.  Start a project with:
        qos new myapp && qos run myapp/app.fpr
      Cross-compiling for QEMU virt (`qos run --on virt`) and QOS Native
      (`qos native`) additionally need riscv64-elf-gcc and qemu:
        brew install riscv64-elf-gcc riscv64-elf-binutils qemu
