/* hostlog.h -- the unified log plane.
 *
 * Every host-side diagnostic used to be a bare fprintf(stderr, ...):
 * under systemd that means journald, invisible to the QOS-side UI --
 * DRM probe results, evdev EACCES, plugin load ranges, mprotect
 * boundaries all vanished from /logs.  qos_hostlog is the one exit:
 * it ALWAYS mirrors to stderr (journald keeps its record), and once
 * the app registers its ring writer (fpr_logput behind the ABI-v4
 * set_log_sink entry) every line ALSO lands in the app's sev-3 (host)
 * ring, browsable as /logs/host.  Lines emitted before registration
 * park in a small pending ring and replay in order at registration,
 * so boot diagnostics are not lost to the UI either.
 *
 * Who calls what:
 *   host code (qosp, gfx.c, evdev_raw.c, ...)  -> qos_hostlog(fmt, ...)
 *   haltab.c fills hal->set_log_sink            = qos_hostlog_set_sink
 *   appside/entry.c registers                   sink = fpr_logput(3,..)
 *   a co-compiled posix image (one address space, no table) may call
 *   qos_hostlog_set_sink directly at init with the same wrapper.
 *
 * THE LAW STILL HOLDS: never call this from an allocation site or a
 * fault handler -- the sink takes the app's log/console locks and
 * byte-loops the UART.  The grow trace and the SIGSEGV report stay on
 * bare stderr for exactly that reason (see the comments at those
 * sites). */
