-- Txn.hs — the script-session TRec.
--
-- `sol script.sol` runs the whole script inside one transaction. Every host
-- file the script touches becomes a TVar-like slot:
--
--   * first READ of a path snapshots its content (or its absence) into the
--     read set; later reads are served from the write set, then the read set
--     — the script sees a stable snapshot plus its own writes
--   * WRITES are buffered in the write set; the disk is never touched
--     mid-script
--   * at exit: lock every touched file (sorted order — no deadlock),
--     VALIDATE the read set against the disk, COMMIT the write set,
--     unlock. If validation fails, the whole script re-runs (STM retry).
--
-- Locks are atomic mkdir locks (<path>.sol-lock) so two concurrent `sol`
-- processes exclude each other portably with no daemon.
--
-- Handles: `open` registers a path and returns a handle id; the LINEARITY
-- checker (front-end, compile time) is what guarantees each handle is used
-- exactly once per operation and therefore cannot be leaked or double-closed
-- — the runtime table below just maps ids to paths.

-- ---- REALTIME ESCAPES (outside the transaction) ---------------------------
--
-- Everything above this line is transactional: reads snapshot, writes buffer,
-- and a validation failure re-runs the script with the world untouched. That
-- is the default and it is what you want almost always.
--
-- These are the deliberate holes in it. They exist because three things are
-- genuinely impossible inside a transaction:
--
--   * OBSERVING CHANGE. A transactional read is idempotent by construction —
--     the second `read p` returns the first read's snapshot. A poll/watch/tail
--     loop can therefore never see a file change. rtRead re-reads the disk.
--   * STREAMING OUTPUT. `sh` captures a command's output and hands it back
--     when the command is done, so a four-minute build shows nothing until
--     it finishes. rtShell inherits stdio so the output arrives live.
--   * PROMPTING. `input` slurps all of stdin at once; a prompt loop needs a
--     line at a time, now.
--
-- What you give up, in every case: the operation happens even if the
-- transaction later rolls back, it happens AGAIN on every retry, and its
-- result is not validated at commit. The counter below exists so a run that
-- uses these says so out loud.

-- per-kind use counts, for the warning summary; survives retries

-- ---- commit protocol ------------------------------------------------------
--
-- CRASH-ATOMIC edition. The previous protocol was atomic against script
-- errors and concurrent sol processes, but a crash (kill -9, OOM, power
-- loss) DURING commit could tear it three ways: a half-written file, a
-- half-applied effect log, and stranded .sol-lock dirs that hard-fail
-- every later run. Three mechanisms close those, in order:
--
--   1. writeAtomic: every committed file lands under a temp name, is
--      fsynced, and is renamed over the target. rename(2) is atomic on
--      POSIX, so an individual file is always entirely-old or
--      entirely-new — never torn.
--   2. the REDO JOURNAL: after validation and before any disk mutation,
--      the whole effect log is serialized to <script>.soljournal and
--      fsynced (itself via writeAtomic, so the journal is complete or
--      absent). A crash mid-replay leaves the journal as the authority:
--      the next run (of this script, or any sol that reclaims one of the
--      dead process's locks) REDOES it. File effects are idempotent
--      (absolute content, rename-applied), so redo is safe to repeat.
--      Deferred shell commands are not idempotent; each one that runs is
--      marked in <journal>.done (append + fsync) and redo skips marked
--      ones. The crash window between a command finishing and its marker
--      landing means shell redo is AT-LEAST-ONCE — stated here rather
--      than hidden, and narrower than the every-crash re-run it replaces.
--   3. PID-stamped locks: a lock dir carries an owner file (pid +
--      journal path). acquire probes a contended lock's owner with
--      kill(pid, 0); a dead owner's lock is reclaimed by atomically
--      RENAMING the lock dir (one reclaimer wins the rename, losers keep
--      spinning), finishing the dead owner's journal first if one exists.
--      No daemon, no manual cleanup, and a crashed sol no longer wedges
--      every future run on those paths.
--
-- Honest limits, so nobody reads more than is there: fsync is
-- best-effort (some filesystems lie; we do not detect that); concurrent
-- reclaimers can both redo the same journal (file effects idempotent,
-- shell effects at-least-once as above); and a redo that races a live
-- writer on an UNLOCKED path is possible only if that writer ignores
-- locks — sol processes never do.

-- is the SOL_CRASH_AT hook: die like kill -9 just before applying that

-- The count that comes back is what the receipt reports, so it counts
-- FILE effects whose goal state holds afterwards — nothing else. A

-- effects were validated under lock, so the replay keeps applying them
-- past the failure. Only LATER SHELL commands are skipped (they may
-- have depended on the failed one), each named. The Bool that comes
-- back says a command failed, so the receipt can refuse the word
