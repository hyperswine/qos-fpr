# Scripting with Sol

Sol scripts are HostedBytecode programs: ordinary FP-RISC inference and
functional composition, with the whole script evaluated as one transaction.
This makes them a good fit for replacing scripts whose job is to transform
values, update files, inspect the host, and coordinate external tools.

Run a script with trailing arguments after its path:

```
./fpr sol sol/scripts/version-compare.sol 2.10 2.9
```

`args Unit` returns those trailing arguments as a `List String`. The shell has
already split the command line, so Sol receives each argument as one value;
scripts should pass external arguments onward as lists rather than rebuilding
a shell command string.

## Choose the narrowest effect

Keep calculation total and pure whenever possible. Parse into `Result`, use
`|>?` and `mapOk` to compose fallible work, and keep the final command boundary
small. `version-compare.sol` is the reference shape: all comparison logic is
pure, and only the entry point prints or reports an error.

Use transactional filesystem operations for file transforms. Reads form a
snapshot and writes are buffered until commit. A conflict reruns the complete
script, so replacing a destination is preferable to an untracked append.
`lowercase.sol` demonstrates this shape.

Use `Proc.query` for read-only host observations. A query may run again if the
transaction retries, so it must not mutate the host. Its structured result can
feed a later transactional write, as in `system-report.sol`.

Use `Proc.afterCommit` for a repeatable external mutation. It queues a
structured process specification and cannot run in an abandoned transaction
attempt. Deferred commands run in order after the filesystem commit and are
recoverable from the redo journal. Recovery gives at-least-once execution, so
the command must tolerate repetition. `archive.sol` uses `tar -czf`, whose
rerun replaces the named archive.

Use `Proc.runNow` only when the effect is genuinely realtime and cannot wait
for commit. It deliberately leaves the rollback model; keep it visible at the
top-level boundary rather than hiding it in a helper.

## Current utility suite

| Script | Shape | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version-compare.sol` | pure | Compare numeric dotted versions |
| `lowercase.sol` | transactional file transform | Lowercase UTF-8 text |
| `system-report.sol` | queries plus optional transaction | Collect a host report |
| `archive.sol` | deferred process | Create a gzip tar archive |

These are semantic replacements, not line-for-line shell translations. There
are no pipelines, word splitting, glob interpolation, or `eval`. External
programs receive explicit argument vectors through `Proc.spec`.

## JSON and CSV

`lib/json.sol` and `lib/csv.sol` treat both formats as values, so a data
job is one railway pipeline: parse into a value, reshape it with pure
functions, render it back, and let the transaction land the files.

```
J = use "../lib/json".   C = use "../lib/csv".
JStr = J.JStr.  JObj = J.JObj.                # constructors come in by alias

> doc = unwrap (J.parse (readPath "in.json"));
  city = J.path ["address", "city"] doc |>? J.text;         # Result String
  out = doc |> J.set "tier" (JStr "gold") |> J.without "tags";
  writePath "out.json" (J.pretty out).

> recs = C.records (unwrap (C.parse (readPath "orders.csv")));   # (column, value) rows
  good = List.filter (fn r -> isOk (C.col "amount" r |>? Try.parseNum)) recs;
  writePath "clean.csv" (C.render (C.table ["order", "amount"] good)).
```

`J.parse` / `C.parse` return `Result`; `J.get`, `J.at`, `J.path`, `J.num`,
`J.text`, `J.bool`, `J.items`, `J.fields` and `C.col` are railway steps, so a
missing key or a non-number derails the chain with a named `Err` instead of
a panic.  Numbers ride the Numeric surface via `Try.parseNum` (integers stay
exact, decimals are inexact).  Object keys keep document order, so
`parse |> render` is the identity up to whitespace; `C.parse |> C.render`
is the identity including quoted commas, newlines and doubled quotes.
Inside a Sol string literal `{` and `}` are interpolation, so inline JSON
text is written with `\{` and `\}`.  `J.ofRecord` lifts a CSV record into
a JSON object, which is the whole CSV-to-JSON bridge.

`sol/examples/jsoncsv.sol` is the executable spec for both libraries.

## Boundaries

- Host commands are capabilities of the machine running Sol. Check and report
  failures instead of assuming every Unix tool exists.
- A `Proc.query` observation is not part of the filesystem conflict set. A
  retry takes a fresh observation, but the external world can change later.
- `Proc.afterCommit` does not roll back an external command that partially
  succeeds. Prefer replacement-style or otherwise idempotent operations.
- Do not put passwords, tokens, or encryption passphrases in script arguments
  or `ProcessSpec`: process arguments and deferred journals are not secret
  stores. Secret input needs a dedicated non-serialized runtime capability.
- Interactive loops and live terminal interfaces are realtime applications,
  not whole-script transactions. They need an explicit runtime boundary rather
  than recursive use of immediate host commands.
